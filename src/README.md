Python scripts and small programs for analyzing different aspects of Y chromosome sequences

## depth
* Use read depth of y chromosome sequences to elucidate structural variations

## divergence
* Use SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to analyze diversity between populations

## par_boundary
* Use read depth again to find PAR boundary.
* The reference for these alignments do no include the Y assembly.
* Theory is, PAR region should have comparable read depth to X chromosome, but      significantly less coverage past the boundary, because this region of the Y does not align to the X.
